Welcome to my personal blog. I am a data scientist with a background in physics. To study physics is to seek the beautifully simple models of describing complex phenomena. I love taking the same approach when playing with data to develop new insights.

I plan to focus on data science in a business setting. That means that while I continually explore academic work, I focus on how statistics, data science, computer science, and machine learning can be incorporate in practice.

My purpose of this blog is a consolidation of my thoughts and notes. The audience for whom I am writing is future-me. But I hope that that this is useful to other people.

If you have any questions, please send me and email: [blog@gardner.fyi](mailto:blog@gardner.fyi)
