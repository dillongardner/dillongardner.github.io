### About me

Data scientist with a background in condensed matter experimental physics. To study physics is to seek the beautifully simple models of describing complex phenomena. I love taking the same approach when playing with data to develop new insights. I have experience across the entire pipeline: from a vague idea, to defined data-centric question, through data cleaning and aggregation, algorithm research and development, and finalized result or product.
